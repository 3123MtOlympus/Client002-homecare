                        Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) reports that approximately 1 in 36 children in
                        the United States are diagnosed with ASD. Among them, boys are about four times more likely to
                        be diagnosed with autism than girls. The CDC estimates that 1 in 23 boys are diagnosed with
                        autism, compared to 1 in 100 girls. Boys often display more overt behavioral symptoms associated
                        with autism, such as repetitive behaviors or difficulties with social interactions, which may
                        contribute to the higher diagnosis rates. </p>

        <h3>Pax Labor</h3>
        <p>
            Pax Labor is a pioneering organization dedicated to supporting the autism community by providing trusted and
            compassionate caregivers who understand the unique needs of individuals with autism. With over a decade of
            advocacy, Pax Labor has become a beacon of hope for families seeking reliable and empathetic care for their
            loved ones. The organization recognizes the profound impact that a skilled and understanding caregiver can
            have on the life of an autistic individual, from enhancing daily living skills to fostering social
            connections and emotional well-being.
        </p>

        <br>

        <p>
            At the heart of Pax Labor's mission is the belief that every individual with autism deserves a caregiver who
            is not only well-trained but also genuinely committed to their growth and happiness. This commitment to
            quality care is what sets Pax Labor apart, ensuring that each caregiver is selected through a rigorous
            process that prioritizes both professional qualifications and a deep sense of empathy.
        </p>

        <br>

        <p>
            Pax Labor also emphasizes the importance of male support in caregiving, understanding the vital role that
            male caregivers can play in the lives of children with autism. By actively promoting male employment in the
            caregiving sector, Pax Labor is breaking down stereotypes and fostering a diverse and inclusive environment
            where every child can thrive.
        </p>

        <br>

        <p>
            In a world where finding the right caregiver can be a daunting task, Pax Labor stands as a trusted partner
            for families, offering peace of mind and a commitment to the well-being of the autism community.
