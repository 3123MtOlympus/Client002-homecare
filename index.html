                    <p class="card-text">Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is more common in males than females. The
                        Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) reports that approximately 1 in 36 children in
                        the United States are diagnosed with ASD. Among them, boys are about four times more likely to
                        be diagnosed with autism than girls. The CDC estimates that 1 in 23 boys are diagnosed with
                        autism, compared to 1 in 100 girls. Boys often display more overt behavioral symptoms associated
                        with autism, such as repetitive behaviors or difficulties with social interactions, which may
                        contribute to the higher diagnosis rates. Boys with autism may
                        experience various challenges, including communication difficulties, social interaction
                        challenges, and repetitive behaviors.</p>

                    <h5 class="card-title">Why a Male Caregiver?</h5>
                    <p class="card-text">For boys with autism, having a positive male companion can play a crucial role
                        in their development and well-being. Male companions, whether they are fathers, mentors, or role
                        models, provide essential support and understanding that can resonate deeply with a boyâ€™s
                        experiences. They offer unique perspectives and relatable guidance, helping to bridge social and
                        emotional gaps. This relationship can foster confidence, build social skills, and provide a
                        stable, supportive presence that reinforces positive behaviors and emotional resilience.
